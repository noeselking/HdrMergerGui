# HdrMergerGui
This tool is a frontend for pfstools to make combining bracketed shots into HDR images easy.
It is written in python, so it should be portable. I am using Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) for
development, so it may not run out of the box on other platforms.

# Dependencies
If run on Ubuntu 16.04 you need to install (at least) the following packages:
 * python3
 * python3-pyqt5
 * python3-exif
 * pfstools
